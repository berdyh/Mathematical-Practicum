# Math C++ Course
This repository contains the materials for the C++ course for math students at RWTH Aachen University. The course is designed to provide a practical introduction to C++ programming, focusing on refactoring code and software design principles.
The course is intended for students who have a basic understanding of programming and want to learn how to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code in C++.

## To run the code
Use the following command to compile and run the test program for the first exercise:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic aufgabe_1_test.cpp prime_printer.cpp -o testA1
./testA1
```

Use the following command to compile and print out the prime numbers:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic aufgabe_1.cpp prime_printer.cpp -o printPrimeNumber
./printPrimeNumber
```
